## Known Issues

None currently

## Architecture Decisions

- **Language**: Python 3.7+ for simplicity and rich library ecosystem
- **Parser**: BeautifulSoup4 with lxml for reliable HTML parsing
- **HTTP Client**: requests library with proper headers for TMDb/IMDb access
- **API**: TMDb API for reliable genre data (replaced IMDb scraping)
- **Config Format**: YAML for human-readable genre configuration
- **Organization**: Downloads structured by year/movie_name/{base_name}_{SIZE}_{dimensions}.jpg
- **Priority Logic**: Hard-coded preference for XXLG > XLG (not dynamic dimension comparison)
- **CLI**: argparse for robust command-line interface

## Dependencies

- requests >= 2.31.0
- beautifulsoup4 >= 4.12.0
- lxml >= 4.9.0
- python-dotenv >= 1.0.0
- pyyaml >= 6.0.0

## Production Capabilities

### Scale Tested
- Recent additions: 50 posters per page
- Multi-page: 374 posters across 10 pages
- Year-based: 2,135 posters for 2024
- Total available: 1,638+ archive pages, 10+ years of posters

### Performance
- TMDb API: ~1-2 requests per poster
- Download speed: Limited by bandwidth
- Error handling: Continues on failures, shows final stats

### Automation Ready
- No interactive prompts in CLI mode
- Can be scheduled via cron/launchd
- Comprehensive logging and progress output
- Graceful error handling

## Next Steps (Future Enhancements)

- [ ] Download all posters for a specific movie
- [ ] Resume capability for interrupted downloads
- [ ] Parallel downloads for faster processing
- [ ] Database/JSON export of metadata
- [ ] Duplicate detection
